COVID-19 GLOBAL DATA TRACKER

This project builds a notebook and data analysis on global COVID-19 trends.It analyses the cases,deaths,recoveries and vaccinations across countries over time.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

- Analyze trends over time for cases,deaths and vaccinations for COVID-19
- Compare the metrics across countries and regions
- visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF Report.

###### LIST OF TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Visualizations & Insights

### ######### 1. Top 15 Countries by Total Cases
- The United States leads with the highest total cases.
- Countries like India, Brazil, and Russia also have significantly high case counts.

## 2. Death Rate Calculation
- Death Rate = `(Total Deaths / Total Cases) * 100`
- Some countries show unusually high death rates, likely due to underreporting of cases or poor healthcare infrastructure.

### 3. Vaccination Progress
- India shows the steepest vaccination curve.
- South Africa shows moderate progress.
- Kenya lags behind in vaccination rollout.

##  Sample Charts

- Bar plot of top 15 countries with most total cases.
- Line chart of total vaccinations over time for selected countries.
- Line chart of total deaths and cases over time.
- Bar chart comparing daily new cases.

######  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Load the data:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv")
Run the analysis and generate the visualizations.

# Conclusion
This project helps visualize how different countries responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of spread, fatalities, and vaccine deployment. It highlights the disparity in health infrastructure and global vaccine equity.
